## Features
- **Node.js & Express**: Lightweight and efficient backend structure.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Data storage and retrieval using Mongoose.
- **API Routing**: Organized routes for user requests.
- **Utilities**: Modular utilities for common tasks.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB instance running.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LVSSandeepKumar/SmokeTrees_assignment.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd SmokeTrees_assignment
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI).
5. Start the server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage
Make API requests to the defined routes to interact with the system. Refer to the `routes` folder for the available endpoints.
